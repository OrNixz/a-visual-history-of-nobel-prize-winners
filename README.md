# A Visual History of Nobel Prize Winners

After a couple of busy weeks, I was finally happy to complete my fourth project provided by DataCamp on the Data Scientist with Python Track. In the previous lessons, we have learned Python Data Science Toolbox (Part 2) and Intermediate Data Visualization with Seaborn. We explored how to use iterators, zip, enumerate, various list and dict comprehensions, and generators. We also went deeper into data visualization using Seaborn, such as regression and residual plots, heatmaps, catplots, lmplots, and various seaborn function parameters. In this project, we did not focus too much on the newly taught material but rather emphasized the basic but often overlooked concept of Data Manipulation algorithms.


## Project Description

The Nobel Prize is arguably the most recognizable scientific honor in the world. It is awarded annually to academics and researchers in the areas of chemistry, literature, physics, medicine, economics, and world peace. The first Nobel Prize was awarded in 1901, and although it was initially Eurocentric and Male-focused, it is now completely Biased-Free. Surely, you say?


Let's find out, then! What traits do the award recipients possess? Which nation receives it most frequently? Has anyone received it twice? You have to work this out on your own.

The Nobel Foundation's data collection is available on Kaggle and was used in this study.
